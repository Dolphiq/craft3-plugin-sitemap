## Currently the project is *DISCONTINUED*. However, feel free to fork it and continue its development!

Craft 3 plugin that provides an easy way to enable and manage a XML sitemap for search engines like Google and Bing

## Using the XML-sitemap plugin

After the installation, you can find the plugin in the settings section of the Control Panel.
You can enable and set the settings per entries section and enable categories in the sitemap.

After saving the desired settings, you can submit the xml url (your site url)/sitemap.xml to the searchengines.

## Sitemap structure
The sitemap is compatible with the [sitemaps.org](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) protocol.

In version 1.0.9 we added support for alternate languages to give [Google a better chance to point to the correct page](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2620865?hl=en).
```
  <url>
    <loc>https://othersite.local/news/news-item-1</loc>
    <priority>0.5</priority>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <lastmod>2018-02-21T21:09:47+01:00</lastmod>
